# Introduction
Hello, world. This is the first essay on my website. As I have mentioned on the index page of this site, I write essays about topics that I am learning and things that I am building. I aim to utilize the *Feynman technique* to better understand what I am learning about, and also to improve reading, comprehension, writing, and articulation skills. A potential side effect is that readers or viewers may benefit from these essays.

When I get stuck while trying to learn something or when I am trying to build something, I have a process (in no order) to solve the problem: search on Google, Google "dork," search related online forums and blog posts, search mainstream social media sites, prompt an LLM, etc. I want to compile all the information and resources I've sifted through to solve a specific problem. Some of the problems I have encountered are very niche and specific, and not much information, if any at all, has been posted online.
