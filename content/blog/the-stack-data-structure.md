# What is a stack?
A data structure that follows the *Last In, First Out Principle* (LIFO). This means any element that is added to the stack gets added on top of the previously added element. Think of a stack of thick, fluffy, slightly toasted, golden brown pancakes covered in syrup, and topped with slices of melting real butter.

# Operations
There are a several operations that are commonly associated and used with the stack. Some of these names you may have seen in the syntax of programming languages such as JavaScript.

## push
Adds a new element to the top of the stack.

## pop
Removes the last added element from the stack. Usually returns the element as well.

## peek or top
Return the last added element from the stack. Does not remove the element.

## empty
Returns a boolean on the condition of if the stack is empty.
