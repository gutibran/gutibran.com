Hello, world. I am Brandon Gutierrez. I enjoy working with computers. Currently, I am studying electrical engineering and applied mathematics at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. If you would like to contact me on most mainstream social networks, you can find me under the handle gutibran. Feel free to send me a direct message. Alternatively, you can contact me via email by sending your message to bran(at)gutibran(dot)com. If you are a potential employer, you can view my résumé. Lastly, I write about topics that I am learning about and things I am building. If you are interested in reading about that, check out my essays.
