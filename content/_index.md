Hello, world. I am Brandon Gutierrez. I like to work with computers. I am studying electrical engineering and applied mathematics at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. If you would like to contact me feel free to send an email to bran(at)gutibran(dot)com. If you are a potential employer check out my [résumé](/brandon-gutierrez-résumé.pdf). Lastly I write about topics that I am learning and things that I am building, if you are interested in reading about that check out my [essays](/essays).
