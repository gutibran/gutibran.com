This is how roman numerals work. It is useful information for solving [LeetCode 13: roman to integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/). My write up for it is [here](/articles/leetcode-13-roman-to-integer). I knew what roman numerals were but did not know how they worked which rendered LeetCode 13 to be "hard" to me, initially.

The roman numerals:
- $\text{I} = 1$ 
- $\text{V} = 5$
- $\text{X} = 10$
- $\text{L} = 50$
- $\text{C} = 100$ (century)
- $\text{D} = 500$
- $\text{M} = 1000$ (millennia)
