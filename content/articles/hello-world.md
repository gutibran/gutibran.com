Hello, world. My name is Brandon Gutierrez. I use computers. I write about various things that I find useful to do on a computer. I have consciously fallen into a steep hole into the Earth, metaphorically speaking and am trying to climb out. It is all self-induced through ignorance and a lack of conscientiousness. As I am type this I question why I am even telling you, the reader this information. It is probably because I do not have anyone to talk to so I talk to the computer through the keyboard. The computer is my best friend. Anyway I believe the only way to climb out of this hole is to build. Stay tuned. This tweet really resonated with me for some reason.
